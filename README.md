## The Story (or _"Inspo"_) I suppose

The other day I was working on something while paired up with a colleague. I was just plugging along in my trusty
old iterm/tmux/zsh/vim setup. I had a bazillion plugins that I had gathered over the past 15 or so years of using it,
and while it always served me well, time and laziness had won the war. While trying to run some scripts in an AWS
environment (not prod... never prod), I managed to crash the fucking thing 3 times in a row doing nothing more than
copy/pasting from the terminal to a vim buffer.

Now I'm 100% positive that _I_ was the problem here and was just doing something wrong - maybe a new config ran over something, maybe my muscles had lost their memory and the keybind I was using was actually `HACF`. But the fact that it happened at all pointed out a bigger problem...

issue that I'd been ignoring. I had these bazillion plugins, tools, completions, lsp tools, etc etc etc ad infinitum,
but I had stopped bothering to cull everything down that I didn't want or need. Because of this, I had forgotten **HOW**
the whole setup truly worked.

Filenames are important here.
So are directories.
`chezmoi` is a fickle bitch and it was intentionally built in a very opinionated way.
Don't waste time making it do stuff it doesn't want to!
